<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>If you make changes to Venus, you have no obligation to share them.
And unlike systems based on <code>CVS</code> or <code>subversion</code>,
there is no notion of &ldquo;committers&rdquo; &mdash; everybody is
a peer.</p>
<p>If you should chose to share your changes, the steps outlined below may
increase your changes of your code being picked up.</p>

<h3>Documentation and Tests</h3>
<p>For best results, include both documentation and tests in your
contribution.</p>
<p>Documentation can be found in the <code>docs</code> directory.  It is
straight XHTML.</p>
<p>Test cases can be found in the tests directory, and
make use of the
<a href="http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/">py.test</a>.  To run them, simply enter:</p>
<blockquote><pre>py.test tests/</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Git</h3>
<p>If you have done a <a href="index.html">git pull</a>, you have already set up
a repository.  The only additional step you might need to do is to introduce
yourself to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.  Type in the following,
after replacing the <b>bold text</b> with your information:</p>

<blockquote><pre>git config --global user.name '<b>Your Name</b>'
git config --global user.email '<b>youremail</b>@<b>example.com</b>'</pre></blockquote>

<p>Then, simply make the changes you like.  When you are done, type:</p>

<blockquote><pre>git status</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will tell you which files you have modified, and which ones you may
have added.  If you add files and you want them to be included, simply do a:</p>

<blockquote><pre>git add file1 file2...</pre></blockquote>

<p>You can also do a <code>git diff</code> to see if there are any changes
which you made that you don't want included.  I can't tell you how many
debug print statements I have caught this way.</p>

<p>Next, type:</p>

<blockquote><pre>git commit -a</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will allow you to enter a comment describing your change.  If your
repository is already on your web server, simple let others know where they
can find it.  If not, consider using <a href="">github</a> to host your
<a href="http://help.github.com/forking/">fork</a> of Venus.</p>

<h3>Telling others</h3>
<p>Once you have a change worth sharing, post a message on the
<a href="http://lists.planetplanet.org/mailman/listinfo/devel">mailing
list</a>, or use github to send a <a
href="http://github.com/guides/pull-requests">pull request</a>.</p>
