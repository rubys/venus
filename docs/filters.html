<h2>Filters and Plugins</h2>
<p>Filters and plugins are simple Unix pipes.  Input comes in
<code>stdin</code>, parameters come from the config file, and output goes to
<code>stdout</code>.  Anything written to <code>stderr</code> is logged as an
ERROR message.  If no <code>stdout</code> is produced, the entry is not written
to the cache or processed further; in fact, if the entry had previously been
written to the cache, it will be removed.</p>

<p>There are two types of filters supported by Venus, input and template.</p>
<p>Input to an input filter is a aggressively
<a href="normalization.html">normalized</a> entry.  For
example, if a feed is RSS 1.0 with 10 items, the filter will be called ten
times, each with a single Atom 1.0 entry, with all textConstructs
expressed as XHTML, and everything encoded as UTF-8.</p>
<p>Input to a template filter will be the output produced by the template.</p>

<p>You will find a small set of example filters in the <a
href="../filters">filters</a> directory.  The <a
href="../filters/coral_cdn_filter.py">coral cdn filter</a> will change links
to images in the entry itself.  The filters in the <a
href="../filters/stripAd/">stripAd</a> subdirectory will strip specific
types of advertisements that you may find in feeds.</p>

<p>The <a href="../filters/excerpt.py">excerpt</a> filter adds metadata (in
the form of a <code>planet:excerpt</code> element) to the feed itself.  You
can see examples of how parameters are passed to this program in either
<a href="../tests/data/filter/excerpt-images.ini">excerpt-images</a> or 
<a href="../examples/opml-top100.ini">opml-top100.ini</a>.
Alternately parameters may be passed
<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> style, for example: 
<a href="../tests/data/filter/excerpt-images2.ini">excerpt-images2</a>.
</p>

<p>The <a href="../filters/xpath_sifter.py">xpath sifter</a> is a variation of
the above, including or excluding feeds based on the presence (or absence) of
data specified by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/">xpath</a>
expressions.  Again, parameters can be passed as
<a href="../tests/data/filter/xpath-sifter.ini">config options</a> or 
<a href="../tests/data/filter/xpath-sifter2.ini">URI style</a>.
</p>

<p>The <a href="../filters/regexp_sifter.py">regexp sifter</a> operates just
like the xpath sifter, except it uses
<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/re-syntax.html">regular expressions</a>
instead of XPath expressions.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Any filters listed in the <code>[planet]</code> section of your config.ini
will be invoked on all feeds.  Filters listed in individual
<code>[feed]</code> sections will only be invoked on those feeds.
Filters listed in <code>[template]</code> sections will be invoked on the
output of that template.</li>

<li>Input filters are executed when a feed is fetched, and the results are
placed into the cache.  Changing a configuration file alone is not sufficient to
change the contents of the cache &mdash; typically that only occurs after
a feed is modified.</li>

<li>Filters are simply invoked in the order they are listed in the
configuration file (think unix pipes). Planet wide filters are executed before
feed specific filters.</li>

<li>The file extension of the filter is significant.  <code>.py</code> invokes
python. <code>.xslt</code> involkes XSLT.  <code>.sed</code> and
<code>.tmpl</code> (a.k.a. htmltmp) are also options. Other languages, like
perl or ruby or class/jar (java), aren't supported at the moment, but these
would be easy to add.</li>

<li>If the filter name contains a redirection character (<code>&gt;</code>),
then the output stream is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(Unix)">tee</a>d; one branch flows
through the specified filter and the output is planced into the named file; the
other unmodified branch continues onto the next filter, if any.
One use case for this function is to use
<a href="../filters/xhtml2html.plugin">xhtml2html</a> to produce both an XHTML
and an HTML output stream from one source.</li>

<li>Templates written using htmltmpl or django currently only have access to a
fixed set of fields, whereas XSLT and genshi templates have access to
everything.</li>

<li>Plugins differ from filters in that while filters are forked, plugins are
<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-imp.html">imported</a>.  This
means that plugins are limited to Python and are run in-process.  Plugins
therefore have direct access to planet internals like configuration and
logging facitilies, as well as access to the bundled libraries like the
<a href="http://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/">Universal Feed Parser</a> and
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/">html5lib</a>; but it also
means that functions like <code>os.abort()</code> can't be recovered
from.</li>
